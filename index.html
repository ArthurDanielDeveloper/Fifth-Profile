          <h3 class="header">My Values</h3>
             <p>I am a strong team player and have been since high school. I participated in several extracurriclular activities and often lead them. Presently I host weekly game sessions leading friends through challenges while also guiding my family through the discourses of life. I will take this experience and combine it with my passion of problem solving and addiction to feeling of "oh, that's what was wrong" to be <i>dadgrammer</i>, a word I've coined to describe my journey at present and into the future of software programming.</p>
